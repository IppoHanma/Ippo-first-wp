        <p class = "hobbies-text">I'm into a lot of shooter games such as Call of duty, Valorant, and Apex Legends. I also love Minecraft! I'm pretty much down to play any new game tho.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "hobbies-text">I like to solo queue a lot because it lets me enjoy my games without worrying about my social battery getting a hit. But i still do love playing games with friends, especially when everyone is vibing ðŸ¤£</p>

        <br>
        <p class = "hobbies-text">I've been working out since i was 15. I started with just doing push ups in my room in secret because i got inspired by goku when he got a HELLA lot stronger by training under 100x gravity.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "hobbies-text">These days the gyms around me are closed when i'm available so i just bought this pullup/dip station where i just start doing reps when i feel like it. It's honestly giving me more gains than i've ever had.</p>
